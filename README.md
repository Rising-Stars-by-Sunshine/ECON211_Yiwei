## Data
- The first CSV contains China's consumer price index (CPI) data over the past 20 years (2003-2022) including overall CPI, urban CPI, and rural CPI. CPI increased modestly from 101.2 in 2003 to 102.0 in 2022 indicating low inflation. The second CSV shows China's GDP data over the same period. GDP grew substantially from 13.7 trillion yuan in 2003 to 121 trillion yuan in 2022, with especially rapid growth in the last decade. The data shows value added broken down by primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. The tertiary/services sector contributed the most GDP. Overall, the data indicates strong economic growth in China over the past two decades, with GDP rising nearly 10 times while inflation has remained low and stable. The data comes from China's National Bureau of Statistics.
